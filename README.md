## Bugs

**Solved Bugs**
- When I started out with the hacks page I couldnt figure out how to align the diffrent images without them jumping all over the website. I discovered that the "float" tag was ruining it. After getting help from tutor support I learned about "flex" and that helped me solve the issue. 

- Once the desktop alignment was good i had trouble with aligning the page for diffrent devices. Once I fully understood the "flex" attribut it helped me solve it. 

- I had difficulties with the hacks page becouse of the images were diffrent sizings. I solved this by using adobe tool to make them all the same size. 

- I struggled with making the text box on the home page transparrnet. I used the "rgba" to set the color because it can also set the transparency of it.
