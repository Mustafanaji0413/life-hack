## Testing 

- I have tested that this page works in different browsers such as Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.

- I have confirmed that the header, navigation, get in touch, hack, and home are all reliable and understandable. 

- I have confirmed that the form works and the required fields need to be filled out for the form to be able to submit. 


## Bugs

**Solved Bugs**
- When I started with the hacks page I couldn't figure out how to align the different images without them jumping all over the website. I discovered that the "float" tag was ruining it. After getting help from tutor support I learned about "flex" and that helped me solve the issue. 

- Once the desktop alignment was good I had trouble aligning the page for different devices. Once I fully understood the "flex" attribute it helped me solve it. 

- I had difficulties with the hacks page because the images were different sizes. I solved this by using an Adobe tool to make them all the same size. 

- I struggled with making the text box on the home page transparent. I used the "rgba" to set the color because it can also set its transparency of it.



## Validator Testing 

 **HTML**
- No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator. 

**CSS**
- No errors were found when passing through the official Jigsaw validator. 

**Accessibility**
- I have confirmed that the colors and fonts chosen are easy to read and accessible by running it through the lighthouse in dev tools.
